<!-- 1. Create a new dynamic segment tree & 2D segment tree implementation  -->
<!-- 2. Test them via solving some problems -->
<!-- 3. Learn the O(n) memory approach for a dynamic segment tree and other similar things -->
<!-- 4. Learn treaps -->
<!-- 5. Create a treap implementation -->
<!-- 6. Solve problems with treaps -->
<!-- 7. Learn persistent segment trees -->
<!-- 8. Create a persistent segment tree implementation -->
9. Solve problems about PSTs
10. Go back to solve hard segment tree problems
11. 2D segment tree with treaps + persistent treap

When solving problems, solve at least three of that type
