# Competitive Programming Library

This is a collection of my library code and all competitive programming problems I have solved so far.

## How it's structured
- Under contest, my solution to many different problems from various online judges
(Codeforces, USACO, Google Code Jam, and etc.) can be found
- Under templates, the library code for various topics (mathematics, graph theory, data structures, string algorithm) can be found.
- Under scripts, there are shell scripts to simplify the process in coding competitions.
